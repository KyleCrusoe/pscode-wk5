// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
If the number has a value after the decimal point display "Please provide a whole number"
else if the number is 0 display "Zero is neither odd nor even"
else if number divided by 2 is a whole number, display "number is even" 
else if number divided by 1 is not a whole number, display "number is odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

ask for 5 seperate numbers
put numbers into table
sum of all numbers, assign to rangeAvg
find minimum of range, assign to rangeMinimum
find maximum of range, assign to rangeMaximum
display "The average of the input numbers is (rangeAvg), the range maximum is (rangeMaximum), and the range minimum is (rangeMinimum)
